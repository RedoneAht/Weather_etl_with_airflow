# Weather_etl_with_airflow

Welcome to the **Weather_etl_with_airflow** repository! ðŸš€  
This portfolio project showcases an end-to-end ETL pipeline built with Airflow. It extracts weather data for London from the Open-Meteo API, applies transformations, and loads the cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database.
